Public referenda are one of the three bodies of Polkadot / Kusama's governance system, alongside the [council]()
and the [technical committee]().

Public referenda can be proposed and voted on by any token holder in the system
as long as they provide a bond. If a token holder is willing to lock up their
tokens for a longer amount of time they will get their vote amplified.
This mechanism (known as conviction voting) are discussed more fully in the
[governance]() page on the wiki. This guide will instruct token holders how
to proposed and vote on public referenda using the Democracy module.

## Important Parameters

The important parameters to be aware of when voting using the Democracry module are as follow:
